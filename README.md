# hex-row-reduce-mathlib

Part of [`hex`](https://github.com/kim-em/hex-dev), a computer algebra
library for Lean 4. The aim is fast executable code, fully verified, built
with spec-driven development.

`hex-row-reduce-mathlib` is the Mathlib bridge for
[`hex-row-reduce`](https://github.com/leanprover/hex-row-reduce). It proves that
the executable row reduction, rank, row span, and nullspace agree with
Mathlib's noncomputable linear-algebra definitions. It depends on
[`hex-row-reduce`](https://github.com/leanprover/hex-row-reduce),
[`hex-matrix-mathlib`](https://github.com/leanprover/hex-matrix-mathlib), and
Mathlib.

# Quickstart

Add to your `lakefile.toml`:

```toml
[[require]]
name = "hex-row-reduce-mathlib"
git = "https://github.com/leanprover/hex-row-reduce-mathlib.git"
rev = "main"
```

```lean
import HexRowReduceMathlib

open HexMatrixMathlib

-- The computed rank agrees with Mathlib's `Matrix.rank`.
#check @rank_eq

-- The computed nullspace basis spans exactly the kernel of `mulVecLin`.
#check @nullspace_span_eq_ker

-- The executable span-membership test agrees with `Submodule.span`.
#check @spanContains_iff_mem_span
```

# Field inverse and complete solve

`inverse?_eq_inv` identifies a successful executable inverse with Mathlib's
`Matrix.inv`. `inverse?_eq_none` identifies failure with determinant zero;
Mathlib's zero inverse at singular input is not an executable inverse witness.

`solve?_spec` identifies the solution set with an affine translate of the
kernel of `Matrix.mulVecLin`. `solve?_parameters` gives its unique basis
coefficients, and `solve?_span` connects the returned columns to
`nullspace_span_eq_ker`. `solve_error` transports the actual separating row;
`solve?_none_witness` characterises failure by existence of a left-kernel
separator. All statements include zero dimensions and rectangular systems.

The companion uses Mathlib's `[Field F]` and its induced `Lean.Grind.Field F`.
Select that instance before constructing matrices or calling elimination; the
companion does not identify it with an independently installed executable
field. `Examples/RowReduce.lean` in hex-dev checks rationals, rational functions,
and entrywise transport from `ZMod64 p` to `ZMod p` without assuming a Mathlib
field on `ZMod64 p`.

# Inverse and solve tactics

`inverse` and `solve` certify closed rational matrix literals. Each tactic
accepts either orientation of its equation:

```lean
example : (!![1, 2; 3, 4] : Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) ℚ)⁻¹ =
    !![-2, 1; 3 / 2, -1 / 2] := by inverse

example : (!![0, 1, 1] : Matrix (Fin 1) (Fin 3) ℚ).mulVec ![3, 0, 2] =
    ![2] := by solve

noncomputable def affine :=
  solve% (!![0, 1, 1] : Matrix (Fin 1) (Fin 3) ℚ) ![2]
```

`inverse` also proves `A * B = 1`; singular inputs prove `A⁻¹ = 0` and
decline product goals with a nonzero kernel vector. `inverse% A` returns
an `InverseResult A`, containing either the literal inverse with both
product identities, or a nonzero kernel vector with singularity proofs.

`solve` checks any supplied solution, proves `∃ x, A.mulVec x = b`, or
proves its negation with a separating row. `solve% A b` returns a
`SolveResult A b`: either a particular solution and literal nullspace basis
with unique affine coordinates, or a separator with `yᵀA = 0` and
`yᵀb ≠ 0`. Particular solutions returned by the producer have zero free
coordinates. Both term forms handle empty shapes.

Arithmetic proof checking uses scaled integer lists and structural recursion.
`HexMatrixMathlib.inverse_of_checkList`, `solve_of_checkList` and
`solveResult_of_checkList` prove soundness for arbitrary passing certificates;
their proofs do not replay elimination. The initial numeric handler accepts
`ℚ`; other carriers are available to separately registered extensions.

For function literals, give the matrix a named `Matrix`-typed definition
before writing `A⁻¹`: Lean can select pointwise function inversion for a
bare lambda. The tactic accepts matrix inversion and multiplication.
The dimension limit is 32 per axis; the measured performance ladder covers
square matrices through 16 and rectangular solve systems through 32 × 16
or 16 × 32. The limit is not a runtime guarantee for other inputs.

# Functionality

The library transports the executable row-reduction data of an
`Hex.Matrix R n m` to Mathlib's function-based matrix `matrixEquiv M`, then
states the correspondence theorems:

- `vectorEquiv_vecMul`: an executable row combination transports to
  Mathlib's `Fintype.linearCombination` over the rows of `matrixEquiv M`;
- `spanCoeffs_eq_linearCombination` and `spanContains_iff_mem_span`: the
  executable span witnesses and the decidable span-membership test agree with
  `Submodule.span`;
- `rowReduce_echelon_row_mem_span` and
  `rowReduce_mem_span_echelon_of_mem_span`: row reduction preserves the row
  span, in both directions;
- `nullspace_mem_ker` and `nullspace_span_eq_ker`: the computed nullspace
  basis lies in, and spans, `LinearMap.ker (Matrix.mulVecLin (matrixEquiv M))`;
- `rank_eq`: the rank from row reduction equals `Matrix.rank (matrixEquiv M)`.

# Verification

Over a `Field R`, the correspondence is fully proven. The computed rank,
row span, and nullspace are computable witnesses for Mathlib's noncomputable
`Matrix.rank`, `Submodule.span`, and `LinearMap.ker` definitions.

Rank, `rank_eq`:

```lean
theorem rank_eq [Field R]
    {M : Hex.Matrix R n m} {D : Hex.Matrix.RowEchelonData R n m}
    (E : Hex.Matrix.IsRowReduced M D) :
    D.rank = _root_.Matrix.rank (matrixEquiv M)
```

Nullspace, `nullspace_span_eq_ker`:

```lean
theorem nullspace_span_eq_ker [Field R]
    {M : Hex.Matrix R n m} {D : Hex.Matrix.RowEchelonData R n m}
    (E : Hex.Matrix.IsRowReduced M D) :
    Submodule.span R (Set.range fun k : Fin (m - D.rank) => vectorEquiv (E.nullspace.get k)) =
      LinearMap.ker (_root_.Matrix.mulVecLin (matrixEquiv M))
```

Span, `spanContains_iff_mem_span`:

```lean
theorem spanContains_iff_mem_span [Field R] [DecidableEq R]
    {M : Hex.Matrix R n m} {D : Hex.Matrix.RowEchelonData R n m}
    (E : Hex.Matrix.IsRowReduced M D) (v : Vector R m) :
    E.toIsEchelonForm.spanContains v = true ↔
      vectorEquiv v ∈ Submodule.span R (Set.range (_root_.Matrix.row (matrixEquiv M)))
```

# Contributing

Development happens in the [`hex-dev`](https://github.com/kim-em/hex-dev)
monorepo, not in this published mirror. Contributions are welcome as pull
requests to the `SPEC/` directory: describe the behaviour you want, and
leave the implementation to the maintainer.
