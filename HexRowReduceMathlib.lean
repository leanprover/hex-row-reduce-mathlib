The `HexRowReduceMathlib` library is the Mathlib bridge for `hex-row-reduce`. It
connects the executable RREF / rank / span / nullspace machinery to Mathlib's
linear-algebra `rank`, span, and kernel definitions. Field inversion agrees
with the nonsingular inverse; solving characterises the complete affine
solution set and its inconsistency certificates. These results build on the
base matrix equivalence in `HexMatrixMathlib`.
